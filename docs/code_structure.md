## Web Server
Todo:
  - Get basic game view render
  - port to FastAPI
  - containerise a web stack (https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi)
  - create a devops pipeline git -> docker -> droplet 

## Game Engine
Todo:
  - Get a running game loop and session manager.
  - Scripting engine

This will be a time-consuming thing to complete and is low priority at the moment. 

## Resource Management
Todo:
  - Primary secondly file principle 

Resources have both an ID and a NAME; one or both mush be present.
Neither is required to be globally unique, but must be unique for the resource type (eg sprite).

The following types of resources are supported:
  - Sprite
  - Map
  - NPC Database
  - Script
  - Sound_FX
  - Music
  - Palette

Note: there are no "image" resources, everything is a sprite.

A resource maps to a folder with a name derived from the TYPE + (NAME or ID).
This folder contains multiple files concerning the resource.

Files starting with a "_"  (eg: "_frame_0021.pmg") are considered "secondary files", 
the others are primary files. Secondary files are generated by the resource manager 
from the primary files. They can be safely deleted if modifying game content.


Assets:
  - store meta data for the viewer and editor
  - store a slug representing the folder
  - stack to override each other
  - create secondary files from primary files
  - validate their own structure

Producer:
  - holds raw data, such as images and sound in memory
  - can perform operations on the data
  - can "bake" that data to an asset.
  - The asset will typically spawn a producer to create the secondary files



## Might & Magic
Todo:
  - Catalog sprites
  - Load Event scripts
  - Sound FX
  - Music
  - MaM 3 support
  - MaM 1&2 support

This concerns extracting game data and "baking" it to the resource file format.
